## 🚀 Running Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js `^18.17` or `^20.3` or `>=21`
- npm (or pnpm/yarn)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project (free tier is enough)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```shell
   git clone <repo-url> && cd waitlist
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create `.env.local`** at the project root (use `.env.example` as reference):
   ```env
   SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-strong-password
   VERCEL_PROJECT_URL=https://vercel.com/your-username/your-project
   ```

4. **Set up Supabase:**
   - Create two tables: `waitlist_signups` and `job_applications`
   - Create a public Storage bucket named `resumes`

5. **Run the dev server**
   ```shell
   npm start
   ```
   The site will open at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm start` | Start the dev server (SSR mode) with HMR |
| `npm run build` | Production build (client + server) |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint on `src/**/*.ts*` |
| `npm run fmt` | Format the codebase with Prettier |
| `npm run deploy` | Deploy to Vercel via the Vercel CLI |

---

## ☁️ Deployment

The project is deployed on **Vercel Edge Functions** (V8 isolates that run
geographically close to each user, with near-zero cold start).

### Required environment variables (set in Vercel dashboard)

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_URL`

### Deploy options

- **Git integration (recommended):** push to your repo connected to Vercel — every push triggers an automatic deploy.
- **CLI:**
  ```shell
  npm run deploy
  ```

The build command is `npm run build`, which runs both the client build (Vite) and the server build (Vercel Edge adapter).

## 🌟 Improvements over the Original Waitlist

- 🔗 Footer with company social links (LinkedIn)
- 📧 Email field standardized between home and job application form
- ✅ Visual confirmation after signup (native `<dialog>`)
- 🚫 Custom Not Found page (instead of the default 404)
- 💬 Clearer required-field validation messages

---

## 🧗 Challenges Faced

- 🎨 **Background gradient** — replicating the original purple radial took multiple `radial-gradient()` layers via a CSS custom property
- 🔤 **Premium fonts** in the original — substituted with **Inter** + **Geist** (free on Google Fonts, visually close)
- 📐 **Pixel-perfect styling** is hard — moved from the "Inspect" to the "Computed" tab in DevTools to extract exact values

---

## 🚧 Backlog

- Mobile validation across all 5 pages
- Final styling polish: Home, `/jobs`, `/jobs/[slug]`, Privacy Policy, Not Found
- Confirmation email after waitlist signup / job application
